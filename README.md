# Lua Hangman

Hangman (word-guessing) game implementation in Lua

## How to play

The game works by receiving messages and replying to them with options.

### Available messages:

- "start" Starts a new game with a random word. Replies how many letters the word has and the game status.
- "abandon" Ends the game and replies with the word-guessing
- "letter [letter]" Guess if the letter [letter] is included (only latin letters). Replies Good or Bad Guess and the game status
- "guess [word]" Guess if the word to guess is [word]. Replies if you guessed and the game ended, or if you wasted a guess and the game status.

## Examples:

|Player message|Game response|
|---|---|
|`start`      | `Game started: 4 letter word: ----`|
|`letter A`   | `Bad guess:    4 letter word: ----`|
|`letter M`   | `Good guess:   4 letter word: M---`|
|`guess MISS` | `Bad guess:    4 letter word: M---`|
|`guess MOON` | `Congratulations! You guessed the word 'MOON'`|
|`abandon`    | `You gave up:  The word was: 'MOON'`|
